Life rarely unfolds exactly as we want it to.
And if we stop and think about it, that makes
perfect sense. The scope of life is universal,
and the fact that we are not actually in control
of life's events should be self-evident. The universe
has been around for 13.8 billion years, and the processes
that determine the flow of life around us did not
begin when we were born, nor will they end when we die.
What manifests in front of us at any given moment is
actually something truly extraordinary it is the end
result of all the forces that have been interacting together
for billions of years.
